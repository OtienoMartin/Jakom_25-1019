                1.	That the Lord God of Israel uses this project to lift me financially so that I’m able to sponsor myself to pursue BSc. Mechanical Engineering (Thermofluids thematic area) at the University of Nairobi beginning September 2026.<br><br>
                2.	There is another project that I’m working on, and I needed a motor with high torque and high rpm simultaneously and lower energy consumption. I wasn’t able to find one; so, I decided to build it myself.<br><br>
                3.	To raise money to buy superior tools, equipment and materials even for bigger projects. As well as secure a nicer and bigger place to set up a research lab.<br><br>
                4.	I wrote a theory encompassing Mechanics, and so this project serves as the proof for the said theory.<br>

              The motor has multple advantages; however we'll state three that are very fundamental. <br><br>   
                1. It delivers the performance of a PM magnet and does not use Permanent Magnets (PM). PMs are made of rare earth minerals found in China thus eliminates the interference in the supply chain. <br><br> 
                2. Near frinctionless operations for it is brushless. It's a DC motor that does not have carbon brushes and uses NO PM at the same time different from SRM. <br>
                3. Direct and easy speed control. Do complex circuitry for speed manipulation.
