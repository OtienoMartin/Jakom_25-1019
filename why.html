                1.	That the Lord God of Israel uses this project to lift me financially so that I’m able to sponsor myself to pursue BSc. Mechanical Engineering (Thermofluids thematic area) at the University of Nairobi beginning September 2026.<br>
                2.	There is another project that I’m working on, and I needed a motor with high torque and high rpm simultaneously and lower energy consumption. I wasn’t able to find one; so, I decided to build it myself.<br>
                3.	To raise money to buy superior tools, equipment and materials even for bigger projects. As well as secure a nicer and bigger place to set up a research lab.<br>
                4.	I wrote a theory encompassing Mechanics, and so this project serves as the proof for the said theory.<br>

            <div class="section-content">
                
1.	Uses DC power, making it simple and compatible with common power sources.<br>
2.	Non-permanent-magnet design reduces cost and avoids reliance on rare-earth materials.<br>
3.	Brushless architecture eliminates mechanical wear and increases lifespan.<br>
4.	Capable of very high rotational speeds with stable performance.<br>
5.	Delivers high torque without requiring large or expensive components.<br>
6.	Extremely cheap to build using readily available materials.<br>
7.	Does not require complex circuitry for speed control, keeping the system simple.<br>
8.	Easy and fast to construct with minimal tools or machining.<br>
9.	Low maintenance since there are no brushes or commutators to replace.<br>
10.	High efficiency due to reduced electrical and mechanical losses.<br>
11.	Better thermal performance because heat is generated on the stator, which is easier to cool.<br>
12.	Quiet operation compared to brushed motors.<br>
13.	Customizable coil turns and configuration for tailored torque–speed characteristics.<br>
14.	Robust structure suitable for harsh environments with dust or vibration.
